🚗✨🚕 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard 

Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing road accident data from 2021 and 2022. 
It highlights key metrics, trends, and insights into road casualties across different conditions, vehicles, and road types in urban and rural areas. 
The dashboard is designed for easy interpretation and decision-making, with clean visuals and actionable insights.

🎯Dashboard Highlights
✨Key Metrics (KPIs):

🎇Total casualties: 162,019
🎇Breakdown of fatal, serious, and slight injuries.
🎇Casualties by vehicle type, with a focus on cars (largest share).

✨Monthly Trends:
🎇A comparison of casualties between 2021 and 2022, showing fluctuations across months.

✨Road Type & Surface Analysis:
🎇Casualties by road type (e.g., single carriageways, dual carriageways).
🎇Conditions of road surfaces (dry, wet, icy).

✨Urban vs Rural:

🎇Split between urban (61%) and rural (39%) areas.

✨Daylight vs Darkness:

🎇Casualties categorized by light conditions during accidents.
🎇Data Process Flow

✨Raw Data:
🎇Initial dataset containing accident information.
🎇Includes fields like date, vehicle type, road type, light conditions, and casualties.

🎯Processed Data:
🎇Data was cleaned and organized in the Process Data sheet.
🎇Removed duplicates, standardized fields, and handled missing values.

✨KPIs Extraction:
🎇Calculated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the KPIs Sheet.
🎇Metrics like total casualties, percentages, and breakdowns were computed.

🎯Dashboard Creation:
🎇Dashboard visualized using Excel tools (charts, slicers, conditional formatting).
🎇Designed for interactivity, enabling users to filter by year, road type, or vehicle type.

👌Features
✨Interactivity:
🎇Slicers and filters for dynamic exploration of the data.

✨Visualization:
🎇Pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts to illustrate key patterns.

✨Insights:
🎇Clear indicators show the areas with the highest casualties and trends over time.

✨How to Use the Dashboard
🎇Open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel (ensure macros and interactivity are enabled).

✨Use the slicers to filter data by:
🎇Year (2021 vs 2022).

✨Urban vs Rural areas.
🎇Vehicle type or road type.
🎇Explore the KPIs and graphs for detailed insights.

👌Key Insights
🎇Cars account for the majority of casualties (80%), followed by buses and vans.
🎇Fatal casualties are significantly lower compared to serious and slight injuries.
🎇Dry road surfaces have the highest number of casualties, while icy roads have the least.
🎇Urban areas contribute to a larger share of accidents, but rural areas also have a significant impact.
