Data Processing and Dashboard Creation in Google Sheets
In this project, I processed sales and profit data for products sold in four major Canadian citiesâ€”Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and Ottawaâ€”during 2015. 
The goal was to visualize key sales and profit metrics using a Google Sheets dashboard. Below is a detailed description of the steps I followed in creating the dashboard:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
The raw data consists of sales transactions, including columns for customer details, product information, order dates, and quantities. The first step was to clean the data by:

ðŸŽ‡Calculating the Returned Items Percent: I used the MATCH function to match product IDs in two columns of my dataset to calculate the percentage of returned items.
ðŸŽ‡Extracting Weekdays: I used the VLOOKUP function to extract weekdays for each order based on the order date.
ðŸŽ‡Removing duplicate entries.
ðŸŽ‡Handling missing or inconsistent data, particularly in the columns related to sales and profit values.
ðŸŽ‡Ensuring that all data entries, such as cities and product categories, were properly formatted and consistent.

2. Data Aggregation:
Once the data was cleaned, I focused on aggregating the information to calculate the total sales and profit for each city and product category. This involved:

ðŸŽ‡Summing sales and profit for each city and product category.
ðŸŽ‡Identifying products with negative profit, such as in Montreal, to highlight potential areas of concern.
ðŸŽ‡Creating calculated fields for visualizations that compare sales and profit by weekday and product category.

3. Dashboard Creation:
The dashboard was built in Google Sheets using various visualization tools, including:

ðŸŽ‡Pivot Tables: I used pivot tables to process the data on the same page as the dashboard, which allowed me to quickly aggregate and analyze the data.
ðŸŽ‡City Sales Comparison: Bar charts to show the total sales across the four cities and track performance over time.
ðŸŽ‡Profit Analysis: A section highlighting the products with the highest profit and showing any negative profit, especially in Montreal.
ðŸŽ‡Sales Distribution: Pie charts to show the distribution of sales across different product categories like Technology, Office, and Furniture.
ðŸŽ‡Geographical Visualization: A map showing the sales data for each city, with specific highlights for Montreal, where the profit is negative.
ðŸŽ‡Sales Timeline: A line chart showing the sales and profit over time to identify trends, peaks, and valleys.

4. Interactive Dashboard:
To make the dashboard interactive, I linked all the pivot tables to the data in the dashboard. By doing so, selecting any city, product, 
or sub-product will automatically update all the charts to reflect the chosen item. This allows for a more dynamic and flexible view of the data.

5. Insights and Challenges:
While the dashboard provides a clear visualization of sales and profits for the year, a notable insight is the negative profit for Montreal. 
This prompted further investigation into possible causes, such as product returns or pricing issues. 
I used the dashboard to quickly spot these trends and make data-driven decisions.

6. Conclusion and Future Improvements:
This dashboard effectively visualizes key metrics, but there are areas for improvement:

ðŸŽ‡Data Accuracy: The data might need further validation, particularly for Montreal, to ensure the negative profit is correctly represented.
ðŸŽ‡Additional Analysis: Future iterations could include more advanced analyses, such as forecasting future sales or incorporating customer segmentation.
