Q1:Not boring movies:

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

SELECT *                               -- Selects all columns from the Cinema table
FROM cinema                            -- Specifies the Cinema table as the data source
WHERE id % 2 != 0                      -- Filters movies with an odd id (id is not divisible by 2)
  AND description <> 'boring'          -- Excludes movies where the description is 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;                  -- Orders the results by rating in descending order
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯Tips!
1- Purpose:
This query retrieves movies with odd IDs, excludes those described as 'boring', and sorts them by rating in descending order.

2-Why Use Modulo (%):🤷‍♀
The modulo operator is a common and efficient way to filter odd or even values. It's simple and easy to understand.

3-<> for Exclusion:
<> is SQL's standard inequality operator, ensuring the query excludes unwanted rows (e.g., movies described as 'boring').

4-Best Practices:
Use SELECT * sparingly and specify required columns for better performance and clarity.
Always document the logic behind filters (e.g., why odd IDs are selected).

5-Real-World Use Case:
This query is suitable for scenarios like filtering and ranking movies in a database for recommendations.

+------------+---------------+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

-- Selects the product ID from the Prices table
-- Rounds the calculated average price to 2 decimal places
-- Handles NULL values by returning 0 if there are no matching units sold
SELECT p.product_id, ROUND( IFNULL( SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units), 0), 2) AS average_price     -- Alias for the calculated average price
                                         
FROM prices p                                                                                          -- Prices table containing product prices and date ranges
LEFT JOIN unitssold u                                                                                  -- LEFT JOIN ensures all products are included, even if no units were sold
ON p.product_id = u.product_id                                                                         -- Matches product IDs between Prices and UnitsSold
   AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date                                             -- Ensures the units sold fall within the valid price date range
GROUP BY p.product_id;                                                                                 -- Groups results by product ID for aggregation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯Tips!
1-Purpose:
This query calculates the average price per product based on units sold during valid price periods, handling cases where no units were sold.

2-Handling NULL Values with IFNULL:
If no matching records are found in the unitssold table (e.g., no units sold for a product), the IFNULL function ensures the average price is set to 0 instead of NULL.

3-Why Use LEFT JOIN?🤷‍♀️
Ensures all products in the prices table are included in the result, even if there are no sales records in the unitssold table.

4-Date Range Filter:
The BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date condition ensures that only units sold during the valid price period are included in the calculation.

5-Aggregation and Rounding:
SUM(p.price * u.units) / SUM(u.units): Calculates the weighted average price per product based on units sold.
ROUND(..., 2): Rounds the result to two decimal places for better readability.

6-GROUP BY:
Groups by p.product_id to compute the average price for each product individually.

7-Real-World Use Case:
This query is useful for analyzing product pricing trends, such as determining the effective price customers paid during a specific period.

👌 Key Takeaways:

🎇Data Integration:
Combines data from two tables (prices and unitssold) to calculate weighted averages.

🎇NULL Handling:
Demonstrates the importance of handling missing data using IFNULL.

🎇Scalability:
This pattern can be adapted for other weighted average calculations, such as revenue per unit or cost per item.

🎇SQL Best Practices:
Filters and conditions (e.g., BETWEEN) ensure only relevant data is included in the analysis.
Aggregations (SUM) and rounding improve clarity and precision.
