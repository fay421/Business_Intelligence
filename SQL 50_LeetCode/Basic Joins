Q1: Replace employee ID with the unique identifier

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.
Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

SELECT IFNULL(employeeuni.unique_id, NULL) AS unique_id,                   -- Selects the unique_id from EmployeeUNI or NULL if no match
       employees.name                                                      -- Selects the name of the employee from Employees
FROM employees                                                             -- Specifies the Employees table as the main (left) table
LEFT JOIN employeeuni                                                      -- Performs a LEFT JOIN to include all rows from Employees
ON employees.id = employeeuni.id;                                          -- Matches rows where the id from Employees equals the id from EmployeeUNI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips:

1-Why Use LEFT JOIN?🤷‍♀️
⁕ Use LEFT JOIN when you need all rows from the left table (Employees), regardless of whether there is a match in the right table (EmployeeUNI).
2-IFNULL Clarification:
⁕ The IFNULL function is optional in this case because LEFT JOIN will already produce NULL for unmatched rows. However, including it explicitly can make the intent 
clearer.
3-Improving Readability:
⁕ If you don’t need to explicitly use IFNULL, you can simplify the query by directly selecting employeeuni.unique_id since unmatched rows will naturally result in 
NULL.
4-Potential Use Case:
⁕ This query is helpful for identifying employees who don’t have an associated unique_id in the EmployeeUNI table (those rows will have NULL in the unique_id column).

       s.year,                                                    -- Selects the year of the sale from the Sales table
       s.price                                                    -- Selects the price of the product from the Sales table
FROM sales s                                                      -- Specifies the Sales table (aliased as 's') as the primary table
JOIN product p                                                    -- Performs an INNER JOIN with the Product table (aliased as 'p')
ON s.product_id = p.product_id;                                   -- Matches rows where product_id in Sales equals product_id in Product

Q3: Customer who visited but didn't make any transactions:

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.
Return the result table sorted in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Visits
+----------+-------------+
| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |

| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
SELECT v.customer_id,                                  -- Selects the customer ID from the Visits table
       COUNT(v.customer_id) AS count_no_trans          -- Counts the number of visits without transactions for each customer
FROM visits v                                          -- Specifies the Visits table (aliased as 'v') as the main table
LEFT JOIN transactions t                               -- Performs a LEFT JOIN with the Transactions table (aliased as 't')
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id                             -- Matches rows where the visit_id in Visits equals visit_id in Transactions
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL                         -- Filters only rows where there is no matching transaction (no transaction_id)
GROUP BY v.customer_id;                                -- Groups the result by customer ID to calculate counts per customer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips: 

Why a LEFT JOIN is Used?:🤷‍♀️
1- Include All Rows from the Left Table:
🎇A LEFT JOIN ensures that all rows from the Visits table are included in the result, even if there is no corresponding entry in the Transactions table.

2-Identify Missing Matches:
🎇Rows where t.transaction_id is NULL indicate visits that do not have an associated transaction. 
This behavior is key to identifying customers with visits but no transactions.

3-Preserve Data Integrity:
🎇Using a LEFT JOIN prevents the exclusion of rows from Visits, which might happen with an INNER JOIN. 
This ensures we do not lose any customers or visits when analyzing missing transactions.

4-Filtering with WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL:🤷‍♀️ 
🎇The WHERE clause specifically focuses on the rows where no match exists in the Transactions table, which is crucial for the intended analysis.

5-Group and Aggregate:🤷‍♀️
🎇The GROUP BY clause groups the data by customer_id, allowing the COUNT function to compute the number of visits without transactions for each customer.

Q4: Rising temperature:

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:
Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
SELECT w1.id                                                             -- Selects the ID of the weather record from the first instance of the Weather table (w1)
FROM weather w1                                                          -- Refers to the Weather table as w1 (alias for clarity)
JOIN weather w2                                                          -- Performs an INNER JOIN with a second instance of the Weather table (w2)
ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)               -- Matches rows where w1's recordDate is 1 day after w2's recordDate
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;                                   -- Filters for cases where w1's temperature is higher than w2's
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips: 
1-Use Case:
This query demonstrates a self-join to compare rows within the same table. It’s commonly used for trend analysis 
(e.g., finding days with increasing temperature).
2-Why Use JOIN?:
The self-join allows comparing rows with specific relationships (e.g., consecutive dates) within a single table.
Importance of DATE_ADD:
3-Using the DATE_ADD function simplifies date arithmetic, ensuring the query works with properly formatted date columns.
4-Performance Tip:
If the Weather table is large, ensure an index exists on the recordDate column to improve the performance of the join condition.
5-Output:
The query will return only the id values for rows in w1 where the temperature was higher than on the previous day.

👌Key Takeaways:
🎇Self-Join in Action:
This query is a classic example of using a self-join to compare related rows in the same table.
🎇Date Arithmetic:
Functions like DATE_ADD are essential for date-based comparisons.
🎇Scalability:
The query can be adapted to compare other columns or different date intervals.
🎇Practical Use Case:
This pattern is widely applicable in trend analysis, such as detecting consecutive days with specific conditions.

Q5: Average time of process of machine:
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. 
Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. 
The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:
Input: 
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |

| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |

Solution:
-- Creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the processing time for each process on each machine
WITH ProcessTimes AS ( 
    SELECT machine_id,                                                                                  -- Selects the machine ID
           process_id,                                                                                  -- Selects the process ID
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END)                                      -- Finds the timestamp for the 'end' activity
           - MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS process_time                  -- Calculates the time difference between 'end' and 'start' activities for the process
    FROM Activity                                                                                       -- Uses the Activity table
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id                                                                     -- Groups by machine and process to calculate processing time for each unique process
)
SELECT machine_id,                                                                                      -- Selects the machine ID for final output
       ROUND(AVG(process_time), 3) AS processing_time                                                   -- Calculates the average processing time for each machine and rounds it to 3 decimal places

GROUP BY machine_id;                                                                                    -- Groups by machine ID to calculate the average for each machine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips: 
1-Using a CTE (WITH ProcessTimes):
A Common Table Expression (CTE) simplifies the query by first calculating the processing time for each machine_id and process_id. 
This allows the second part of the query to focus on aggregating the results.
2-CASE with MAX:
The CASE statement extracts the timestamp values for specific activity_type conditions (start or end).
MAX is used because there can only be one start and one end per process, and it ensures the correct timestamp is used.
3-Processing Time Calculation:
The difference between the end and start timestamps (MAX(end) - MAX(start)) gives the processing time for each individual process.
4-Average Processing Time:
In the final query, the average processing time per machine is calculated using AVG(process_time) and rounded to 3 decimal places with ROUND.
5-Grouping:
Step 1: Group by machine_id and process_id in the CTE to calculate processing time for each process.
Step 2: Group by machine_id in the final query to calculate the average processing time for all processes on each machine.

👌Key Takeaways:

🎇Efficient Query Design:
Using a CTE simplifies the logic by breaking down the problem into manageable parts (process time calculation first, followed by averaging).
🎇CASE Expressions for Conditional Aggregation:
Demonstrates a powerful technique for calculating metrics based on specific conditions within a single query.
🎇Practical Use Case:
This query is applicable in real-world scenarios like manufacturing or data processing pipelines where monitoring process times is crucial.
🎇Code Modularity:
The CTE allows for reusability and easier debugging, making the query modular and maintainable.

+------+-------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
SELECT e.name,                                                  -- Selects the name of the employee from the Employee table
       b.bonus                                                  -- Selects the bonus amount from the Bonus table (if available)
FROM employee e                                                 -- Specifies the Employee table (aliased as 'e') as the primary table
LEFT JOIN bonus b                                               -- Performs a LEFT JOIN to include all employees, even those without a bonus
ON e.empId = b.empId                                            -- Matches rows where Employee.empId equals Bonus.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;                        -- Filters employees with a bonus less than 1000 or no bonus at all (NULL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips: 
Why Use a LEFT JOIN?🤷‍♀️
1-A LEFT JOIN ensures all employees are included in the results, even if they have no bonus. This is critical for identifying employees without bonuses.

2-Handling NULL Values:
When working with a LEFT JOIN, unmatched rows in the right table (Bonus) will have NULL values. 
Always explicitly check for IS NULL in the WHERE clause to include those rows.

3-Filtering Multiple Conditions:
The query combines two conditions using OR:
Employees with bonus < 1000.
Employees with no bonus (b.bonus IS NULL).

4-Practical Use Case:
This query is useful for generating reports or identifying employees with low or no bonuses, which could be critical for HR or business analysis.

👌Key Takeaways:
🎇LEFT JOIN is critical for including unmatched rows.
🎇Always use IS NULL to check for missing records in the right table.
🎇Combining multiple conditions (<, IS NULL) is an effective way to target specific data scenarios.
🎇This query demonstrates handling real-world data where some records may be incomplete or missing.

Solution:
SELECT st.student_id,                                                 -- Selects the student ID
       st.student_name,                                               -- Selects the student's name
       s.subject_name,                                                -- Selects the subject name
       COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams                        -- Counts the number of times the student attended the subject exam
FROM students st                                                      -- Refers to the Students table (aliased as 'st')
CROSS JOIN subjects s                                                 -- Generates all possible combinations of students and subjects
LEFT JOIN examinations e                                              -- Performs a LEFT JOIN to match students' exams if they exist
ON st.student_id = e.student_id                                       -- Matches the student ID between Examinations and Students
AND s.subject_name = e.subject_name                                   -- Matches the subject name between Examinations and Subjects
GROUP BY st.student_id, st.student_name, s.subject_name               -- Groups results by student and subject for aggregation
ORDER BY st.student_id, s.subject_name;                               -- Orders the results by student ID and subject name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips:
Why Use CROSS JOIN?🤷‍♀️
1-The CROSS JOIN ensures that all combinations of students and subjects are included, even if no records exist in the Examinations table.
It is essential for identifying students who did not attend any exams for certain subjects.

Why Use LEFT JOIN?🤷‍♀️
2-The LEFT JOIN preserves all rows from the Cartesian product (students and subjects) while including only matching rows from the Examinations table.
This allows the query to handle missing exam records and count them as 0.

Handling Missing Data:
3-COUNT(e.subject_name) works because COUNT ignores NULL values, which naturally results in 0 for subjects with no exams.

Performance Consideration:
4-Be cautious with CROSS JOIN on large datasets, as it generates a large number of rows. However, in this case, it is appropriate for the requirement.

👌Key Takeaways:

🎇Combining CROSS JOIN and LEFT JOIN:
This query showcases how to analyze missing data by combining all possible combinations (CROSS JOIN) and checking for matches with LEFT JOIN.
🎇Practical Use Case:
Useful for generating reports where full coverage of data (e.g., all students for all subjects) is required, regardless of missing records.
🎇Clarity and Modularity:
Using proper aliases (st, s, e) and organized clauses improves readability and maintainability.
🎇Scalable Query:
Works well for small to moderately sized tables but requires performance consideration for very large datasets.

Q8: Managers with at least 5 direct reports:

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:
SELECT a.name                         -- Selects the name of the employee (manager)
FROM employee a                       -- Refers to the Employee table as 'a', representing managers
JOIN employee b                       -- Self-joins the Employee table as 'b', representing subordinates
ON a.id = b.managerId                 -- Matches rows where 'a' (manager) is linked to 'b' (subordinate) via managerId
GROUP BY a.id, a.name                 -- Groups results by manager's ID and name to calculate aggregates
HAVING COUNT(b.managerId) >= 5;       -- Filters to include only managers with 5 or more subordinates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips:
Purpose:
1-This query identifies employees (managers) who manage at least 5 other employees and returns their names.

Why Use Self-Join?🤷‍♀️
2-The JOIN operation is a self-join because the query compares the same table (employee) to itself.
It links the managerId in table b (subordinates) to the id in table a (managers), allowing hierarchical relationships to be queried.

Why Include a.id in GROUP BY but Not in SELECT?🤷‍♀️
3-Including a.id in GROUP BY ensures that each manager is uniquely identified for grouping, even if multiple managers have the same name.
a.id is not in the SELECT because the query only needs to return the manager's name.

HAVING Clause:
4-The HAVING clause filters groups to include only managers who manage at least 5 employees. It works on aggregated data (COUNT).

👌Key Takeaways:

🎇Self-Joins:
Demonstrates how to use self-joins to query hierarchical relationships like manager-subordinate structures.

🎇Best Practices:
Include only necessary columns in the SELECT clause for clarity.
Use GROUP BY to handle grouping, even if some columns are not part of the final output.

🎇Performance Consideration:
Ensure indexes on id and managerId for efficient join and group-by operations on large datasets.

🎇Reusability:
This pattern can be adapted for other hierarchical queries, such as finding top-performing managers or employees under specific managers.
***************************************************************************************************************************************************
Q9: Confirmation rate:
Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.
Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
+---------+---------------------+
Confirmations table:
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
+---------+-------------------+
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

-- Selects the user ID from the Signups table
-- Rounds the calculated confirmation rate to 2 decimal places  
-- Handles NULL values by returning 0 if no confirmation records exist

SELECT s.user_id, ROUND( IFNULL( COUNT(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(c.user_id),0), 2) AS confirmation_rate                                            

FROM signups s                                                 -- Main table containing all user signups
LEFT JOIN confirmations c                                      -- LEFT JOIN ensures all signups are included, even without confirmations
ON s.user_id = c.user_id                                       -- Matches Signups with Confirmations based on user ID
GROUP BY s.user_id;                                            -- Groups results by user ID to calculate metrics for each user
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Tips:
Purpose:
1-This query calculates the confirmation rate for each user as the ratio of confirmed actions to total actions, rounded to two decimal places.
Includes users who have no confirmation records by ensuring their confirmation rate is 0.

Handling NULL Values with IFNULL:
2-The IFNULL function ensures that users without any confirmation records (resulting in NULL) are assigned a confirmation rate of 0.

CASE WHEN for Conditional Aggregation:
3-The CASE expression counts only rows where the action is 'confirmed'. This conditional aggregation ensures precise calculations.

COUNT Logic:
4-COUNT(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 END): Counts only confirmed actions.

COUNT(c.user_id): Counts all confirmation records for the user (both confirmed and timeout).
5-Division of these two values gives the confirmation rate.

LEFT JOIN Usage:
6-Ensures all users from the Signups table are included, even if they do not have any associated confirmation records.

Rounding:
7-ROUND(..., 2) rounds the confirmation rate to 2 decimal places for better readability.

GROUP BY:
8-Groups the data by s.user_id, ensuring that the calculations (counts and rates) are performed for each user.

👌Key Takeaways:

🎇Inclusion of All Users:
Using LEFT JOIN ensures that users without confirmations are accounted for, showcasing robust query design.

🎇Conditional Aggregation:
Demonstrates the use of CASE WHEN for counting specific conditions in aggregate functions.

🎇Real-World Use Case:
This query is applicable in analyzing user behavior, such as calculating conversion or confirmation rates for signups.

🎇Best Practices:
Handles NULL values gracefully with IFNULL.
Uses ROUND for cleaner, user-friendly results.
