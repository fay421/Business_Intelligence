    c.country_name AS team,   -- The country name of the team involved in the shootout, renamed as "team"
    pl.player_name,           -- The player's name

WHERE 
    p.team_id = c.country_id  -- Match team_id in penalty_shootout with country_id in country
    AND p.player_id = pl.player_id  -- Match player_id in penalty_shootout with player_id in player_mast
