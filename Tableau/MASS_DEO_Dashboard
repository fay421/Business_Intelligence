📊 Massachusetts Public Schools Performance Dashboard (Tableau)
🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes public school performance across Massachusetts using data from the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DOE).

The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders understand school system health, identify underperforming areas, and explore how academic outcomes relate to class size and student demographics.

The dataset covers:

1,861 schools

953,748 students statewide

🎯 Key Questions This Dashboard Answers

Which schools have low high school graduation rates?

Is there a relationship between class size and college attendance?

How does 4th grade math performance vary across districts?

Which districts are meeting performance thresholds, and which need more support?

📈 Dashboard Components & Insights
1️⃣ High School Graduation Rate (Left Panel)

Displays schools with the lowest graduation rates

Allows quick identification of schools most at risk

Uses a horizontal bar chart for easy comparison

🔍 Insight:
Graduation rates vary significantly across schools, highlighting inequality in student outcomes.

2️⃣ Class Size vs. College Attendance (Center Panel)

Scatter plot showing:

X-axis: % of students attending college

Y-axis: Average class size

Each dot represents a school

Color intensity reflects economic disadvantage

Includes a trend line

🔍 Insight:
There is a positive correlation between class size and college attendance, but this does not imply causation.
Other factors (school resources, funding, student support) may play a larger role.

3️⃣ District Performance Grouping (Top Right)

Districts are grouped into:

Passing Threshold

Need More Work

Interactive filters allow users to focus on specific performance groups

🔍 Insight:
This view helps decision-makers quickly identify districts requiring intervention.

4️⃣ 4th Grade Math Performance (Right Panel)

Shows MCAS 4th grade math scores by district

Includes a benchmark line for comparison

Highlights districts above and below expected performance

🔍 Insight:
Early math performance varies widely, which may impact long-term academic success.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Tableau – Data visualization & dashboard design

Public Education Data – Massachusetts DOE

Analytical Focus – Education outcomes, equity, system health

📌 Key Takeaways

School performance across Massachusetts is uneven

Correlation ≠ causation when analyzing class size and college attendance

Early academic indicators (like 4th grade math) are critical

Dashboards can replace long reports by providing clear, visual insights
